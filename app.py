    **Description**: The air quality index is based on the concentration of a number of pollutants such as ozone, ammonia, and particulates. 
    I trained an XGBoostClassifier model using a little over two years' worth of historical data from OpenWeather. Then I predict the next three days
    of air quality indices at an hourly resolution. Because training an XGBoostClassifier has some degree of stochasticity, predictions for a particular
    time may change after the model is retrained. New data is downloaded roughly every three days, and the model is automatically retrained. This is my
    first machine learning project where I've gathered my own data and deployed a model. It is also the first time series forecasting project I've done.
    Unfortunately, my model doesn't have the great of performance. The log-loss baseline for the training set is about 0.68 and I wasn't
    able to get below that in cross-validation. This means that the model is no better than randomly guessing the air quality index.
    However, I think with some better feature engineering the model could perform substantially better. Nevertheless, I've learned
    so much about data science, machine learning, GitHub, Gradio, and Hugging Face Spaces with this project and that's what counts.
